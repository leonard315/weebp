/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for CarStoreGo.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for shopping carts and orders, and allows public read access to car listings. Data validation is relaxed for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /cars/{carId}: Stores car details. Publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/cartItems/{cartItemId}: Stores individual cart items. User-owned.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores customer orders. Users can only read their own orders. Admins can read all orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public car listings.
 * - User-owned shopping carts (strict ownership).
 * - User-owned orders (read-only for users), admin can read all.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping but must be tightened later.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Cart items are located under /users/{userId} to leverage path-based authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public car listings are separated from private user carts and orders.
